	  EROFS(Enhanced Read-Only File System) is a lightweight
	  read-only file system with modern designs (eg. page-sized
	  blocks, inline xattrs/data, etc.) for scenarios which need
	  high-performance read-only requirements, eg. firmwares in
	  mobile phone or LIVECDs.

	  It also provides VLE compression support, focusing on
	  random read improvements, keeping relatively lower
	  compression ratios, which is useful for high-performance
	  devices with limited memory and ROM space.

	  If unsure, say N.

config EROFS_FS_DEBUG

	help
	  Print EROFS debugging messages and enable more BUG_ONs
	  which check the filesystem consistency aggressively.

	  For daily use, say N.

	  use vm_map_ram/vm_unmap_ram instead of vmap/vunmap.

	  If you don't know what these are, say N.
